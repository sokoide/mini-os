# Day 10: Sleep and Timing ⏰

## Today's Goal

Implement thread blocking and wake-up mechanisms, including sleep() function with timer-based scheduling.

## Background

Day 9 achieved preemptive multitasking, but threads need ability to voluntarily block (sleep) and be automatically awakened. Today we'll implement thread blocking states and timer-based wake-up system.

## New Concepts

-   **Thread Blocking**: Voluntarily removing thread from READY state until specific condition is met
-   **Sleep Function**: Block thread for specified time duration
-   **Wake-up Mechanism**: Automatically return blocked threads to READY state when conditions are met

## Learning Content

-   BLOCKED thread state management
-   Timer-based sleep() function implementation
-   Wake-up queue processing in timer interrupt
-   Thread state transitions (READY ↔ RUNNING ↔ BLOCKED)

## Task List

-   [ ] Add BLOCKED state handling to scheduler
-   [ ] Implement sleep() function for thread blocking
-   [ ] Create blocked thread list management
-   [ ] Add wake-up processing to timer interrupt handler
-   [ ] Implement wake_up_tick comparison logic
-   [ ] Test sleep functionality with demo threads
-   [ ] Verify threads wake up after specified delays

## Implementation Highlights

- Threads can call `sleep(ticks)` to block themselves
- Blocked threads stored in separate list with wake_up_tick
- Timer interrupt checks blocked list for threads ready to wake
- Sleeping threads automatically return to READY state when timer expires
- Enables more sophisticated thread coordination and timing

This adds essential thread coordination primitives to the operating system.
