# day99_completed - Complete Mini OS Implementation

## Overview

This directory contains the complete, production-ready implementation of the Mini OS with all features from the 12-day curriculum plus additional enhancements.

## Features

### Core OS Components
- **Boot System**: MBR bootloader with A20 enable and protected mode transition
- **Memory Management**: GDT setup and flat memory model 
- **Interrupt System**: IDT with CPU exceptions and hardware interrupt handling
- **Timer System**: PIT-based 100Hz timer interrupts for scheduling
- **Display System**: VGA text mode with color support and cursor control
- **Debug System**: Serial port output for debugging and logging

### Advanced Features  
- **Preemptive Multithreading**: Round-robin scheduling with context switching
- **Thread Management**: Thread creation, scheduling, sleep/wake functionality
- **Keyboard Input**: PS/2 keyboard driver with scan code translation
- **Input Functions**: getchar() and read_line() equivalents to scanf
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and recovery
- **Code Quality**: Well-documented, modular, maintainable code structure

## Architecture

### Key Components

**Threading System**:
- Thread Control Blocks (TCB) with 4KB stacks
- READY, RUNNING, BLOCKED state management  
- Round-robin preemptive scheduling
- Context switching with full register preservation
- Sleep/wake functionality with timer-based scheduling

**Interrupt System**:
- Timer interrupts (IRQ0) for scheduling at 100Hz
- Keyboard interrupts (IRQ1) for real-time input
- CPU exception handling with error reporting
- Proper EOI handling for 8259A PIC

**Memory Layout**:
- 0x7C00: Boot sector (MBR)
- 0x100000: Kernel code and data (1MB)
- 0x200000: Kernel stack (2MB)  
- 0x300000+: Thread stacks and data
- 0xB8000: VGA text buffer

**Build System**:
- Cross-compilation with i686-elf-gcc
- NASM for assembly components
- Custom linker script for precise memory layout
- QEMU integration for testing and debugging

## Usage

### Building
```bash
make clean
make all
```

### Running
```bash
make run          # Run in QEMU
make run-debug    # Run with debugging enabled
make run-serial   # Run with serial output
```

### Testing
```bash
make test         # Run test suite
make test-boot    # Test boot sequence
make test-threads # Test threading system
```

## Technical Details

### Context Switching
- Assembly implementation with pushfd/pusha preservation
- ESP-based stack switching between threads
- Initial stack setup for new threads
- Interrupt-safe switching in timer handler

### Thread Scheduling  
- 100Hz timer provides 10ms time slices
- Round-robin algorithm with READY queue
- Sleep/wake with tick-based timing
- Thread creation with function pointers

### Keyboard Input
- PS/2 controller initialization and handling
- Scan code to ASCII translation tables
- Circular buffer for keystroke storage
- Blocking input functions (getchar, read_line)

### Error Handling
- CPU exception handlers with register dumping
- Stack overflow detection and reporting
- Invalid thread state detection
- Graceful degradation on errors

## Educational Value

This complete implementation demonstrates:
- Real x86 assembly programming techniques
- Hardware-level system programming
- Interrupt-driven architecture
- Multithreading fundamentals  
- Device driver development
- System-level debugging techniques

The code serves as both a working OS kernel and educational reference for understanding how modern operating systems implement core functionality at the hardware level.

## Extensions and Future Work

Potential enhancements include:
- Memory management (paging, heap allocation)
- File system implementation
- Network stack
- GUI system
- Multi-core support
- POSIX compatibility layer

This implementation provides a solid foundation for exploring advanced operating system concepts.
